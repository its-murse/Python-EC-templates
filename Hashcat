#-m 0 specifies the hash type (in this case, MD5).
#-a 0 indicates the attack mode (straight mode, trying all combinations from a given charset).
#hashes.txt is the file containing the hashes to be cracked.
#rockyou.txt is the wordlist used for password guessing.
#Replace hashes.txt with the file containing the hashes you want to crack and rockyou.txt with the path to the wordlist you want to use.
#The command and parameters should be adjusted based on the hash type and the attack mode you're targeting.
