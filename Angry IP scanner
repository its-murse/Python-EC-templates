#The -f:csv flag specifies the output format as CSV.
#-o result.csv indicates the output file where the scan results will be saved.
#-q runs the scan quietly (without the GUI).
#-s {ip_range} specifies the IP range to be scanned.
#This script utilizes the subprocess.run() function to execute Angry IP Scanner from Python.
#It runs the scan based on the provided IP range and saves the results in a CSV file named result.csv.
